## [1.16.8] - 2021-09-26

### Added

-   Added fallback values for the server name (this does allow for all characters to be used), server port (game port), and max player count (check the `example.config.json` file for the structure). These are only used when the server can't be found because of the server name having a symbol or just offline (Note: the worst-case scenario is when the server is offline and the embed status just got generated, then only the location data will be correct, the rest will show "Unknown")

### Changed

-   If RCON connection can't be made to the server, the bot will not make a request to the PlayFab API (saves computing resources)

### Fixed

-   Fixed status embed erroring when the server has a symbol in the name (uses fallback values instead, if they're provided)

### Fixed

-   Duplicate interval update strings were used in the status embed footer

## [1.16.4] - 2021-09-21

### Fixed

-   Using server hostname to determine if the server is the same (fixes the optimization that only worked if the status config was on show IP-PORT mode)
-   Display correct location (to not show a rate-limited message)
-   Some grammar issues in changelog (no I will not update the releases' descriptions)

## [1.16.3] - 2021-09-20

### Changed

-   Different approach when sending a new status message (to avoid duplication)
-   Only fetch the location with the API when the server config IP doesn't match the PlayFab API fetched server IP
-   Might have optimized when the bot should fetch new country data for the status message

## [1.16.2] - 2021-09-19

### Added

-   Added status channel permission set (requires the bot to have the manage channel permission)

### Changed

-   The bot will now remove all status messages and send new ones at launch

-   Fixed teleport location minimum value check using a wrong variable (used MIN_VALUE but documentation explicitly says "Number.MIN_VALUE is the smallest positive number" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MIN_VALUE#description), now using Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MIN_SAFE_INTEGER))

## [1.14.0] - 2021-08-30

## [1.13.1] - 2021-08-29

## [1.11.0] - 2021-08-22

### Added

-   Added auto restarter to the auto-updater system

### Fixed

-   Fixed interactions failing by deferring every command (the reason for interactions failing are probably related to some commands taking too long to respond to the interaction. PS: Mystic rekt! 😁)

## [1.10.2] - 2021-08-11

### Fixed

-   `syncServerPunishments` and `global` punishments will fallback to sending a punishment message to every punishment webhook (and permanent) if the server is not found in the bot (should be rare)

### Fixed

### Added

-   You can now toggle in-game (RCON) commands

### Changed

-   You can now use the `history` command to see admins' punishments given history (this functionality was previously available when using `deletehistory` and used admin as type)

## [1.6.3] - 2021-07-09

### Fixed

-   Auto Updater now sends a message every 5 minutes to remind the user to restart the bot after an update have been installed

### Changed

-   Moved `bannedWords.json` and migration config.json (which is now named `migration.json`) file to root directory of the project
-   Global punishments (`ban` and `mute`) will now override currently applied punishment duration (though if the player is already permanently banned or muted on a server the player's current duration will not be forced)

-   Fixed naughty message notification being sent to activity instead of wanted channel

## [1.4.1] - 2021-07-01

### Added

-   You can now toggle servers to ignore global punishments (using `ignoreGlobalPunishments`)
