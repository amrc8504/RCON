## Overview

A Discord bot that utilizes RCON for the Mordhau server and logs punishments with extra features. It makes use of [Slash Commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands) and has in-game commands. As this is version 2 of AssaultLine's [Mordhau Ban Logger](https://github.com/academy-gaming/mordhaubanlogger) a migration feature has been added. The bot is semi-configurable, some features can be toggled on, off, or customized (like killstreaks). The bot is self-hosted so you need to host the bot on your server.

### Features

-   Per-server punishments saving (You can customize each server to save specific punishment types or just disable it altogether)
-   Sync server punishments (Default: false)
-   Per-server in-game commands specification (You can choose which commands are available in-game)
-   Per discord role slash commands access (You can choose which commands are available for each role, multiple roles can have the same permissions)
-   Global punishments (Servers can be set to ignore global punishments)
-   Killstreaks (You can toggle this feature, as well as a toggle to count bot kills for each server and customize it, for each kill threshold with its message. The available variables are `{name}` and `{kills}`)
-   Automod (Fully customizable, you can also change the profane words list by configuring `bannedWords.json`. The available variables are `{name}` and `{words}`)
-   Admin list saving/rollback (Toggleable feature with notifying only mode)
-   Auto Update (The bot will automatically download and overwrite files as well as auto restart the bot, it's a good idea to check out the patch notes and change `config.json` to match the structure of `example.config.json` (not a requirement as the bot has own config system that has values to fall back to))
-   Warn system (Acts like automod infraction threshold system with a reset after duration (in minutes, default is 1 month). The available variables are `{name}`, `{currentWarns}` and `{maxWarns}` )
-   Teleport system (Dynamically add/remove/edit teleport locations, default: no locations provided)
-   Server status (You do not have to enable `bAdvertiseServerViaSteam` to show server stats, if you use DiscordGSM you have to enable it)
-   Map vote (Works like RTV, Rock The Vote. Enabling the feature will enable the `votemap [map number]` (map number is ignored until the map list message pops up) and `cancelmapvote` (for admins) commands)
-   Admin list command (the ability to see all the admins with when they last played and total playtime past any amount of days, default: 14 days)

### Notices

You can only have a maximum of 25 servers (not that you will have that many) as this is a limitation of Discord\'s Slash Commands.

Invite your bot using the link (replace "\<bot ID\>" with your bot ID): https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<bot ID\>&permissions=536947728&scope=bot%20applications.commands

The auto-updater will download, install all dependencies, build and migrate configs automatically when there's an update available, the only thing you should do is make sure the settings in the `config` files fit your preferences.

To see your coordinates then use `ShowDebug PHYSICS` and look at the left side where it says location and to disable the view use `ShowDebug`

## Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (preferably the latest LTS version).
-   You need to create a MongoDB cluster, you can get one free on MongoDB Atlas, follow the [official guide](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) from part 1 to part 4.
-   [Steam API Key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
-   Setup RCON on the Mordhau server.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `example.config.json` file as `config.json` and edit the settings
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Build the bot: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
5. Start the bot: `npm run start` or `yarn start`
   5.1 (Recommended step) Start the bot with PM2 instead: `pm2 start pm2.json` (PM2 is the only supported process manager for Auto Update restart, others have not been tested, but if it fails it will just send a console log message every 5 minutes notifying the bot has been updated but needs a manual restart)

## Migration

To migrate from the [Mordhau Ban Logger](https://github.com/academy-gaming/mordhaubanlogger) copy-paste the save folder to `dist/migration` (maybe change the files' name to the new desired server name, note: all underscores ("\_") becomes spaces (" ")) and run `npm run migrate` or `yarn migrate`
